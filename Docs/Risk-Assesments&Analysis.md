## Mosquito Breeding Risk Formula and References

The risk scoring model combines four environmental factors based on established research:

1. **Standing Water** (Weight = 40): Mosquitoes must lay eggs on or near standing water, and larvae/pupae develop only in water (CDC, *Life Cycle of Mosquitoes*).
2. **Soil Moisture** (Weight = 25): Moist or damp ground indicates areas of potential water accumulation or poor drainage, which are more likely to hold containers or micro-habitats suitable for breeding (WHO *Operational Guide for Assessing Aedes Breeding Sites*).
3. **Temperature > 28°C** (Weight = 20): The mosquito lifecycle accelerates in warm temperatures affecting egg hatching and larval development (Campbell et al., *The Complex Relationship Between Weather and Dengue*, NCBI PubMed).
4. **Humidity > 70%** (Weight = 15): High relative humidity increases adult mosquito survival and biting activity, contributing to higher transmission potential (vector ecology literature).

These weights are designed to reflect the biological importance of each factor and can be calibrated further using field validation data.
